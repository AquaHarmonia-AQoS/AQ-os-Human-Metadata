# AQ-OS — Project MANIFEST

**Version:** v1.0  
**Status:** Authoritative Index  
**Scope:** Entire Repository  
**Purpose:** Prevent drift, scope creep, and accidental reinterpretation of locked work.

This MANIFEST is the **single source of truth** for the epistemic status of all artifacts in this repository.

If a claim, definition, or guarantee is not consistent with this MANIFEST, it is **not authoritative**.

---

## 🔒 What Is LOCKED (Do Not Modify)

The following artifacts define **foundational constraints**.  
They may not be reinterpreted, extended, or contradicted without:
- an explicit version bump
- a written justification
- and a changelog entry

### Core Foundations

- **AQ_OS Formal Foundations v1.0a**  
  Status: LOCKED  
  Role: Viability core (bounds, metrics, assumptions)  
  Notes: All guarantees originate here.

### Lane 1 — Operator Composition (v1.0)

- Operator taxonomy (boop / bloop / floop / Null Field)
- Chaining lemma and composition bounds
- Order sensitivity rules
- Contractive survival conditions

These define what operators *are allowed* to do.

---

### Lane 2 — Viability Kernels & Geometry (v1.0)

- Viability kernel defined as a **set**, not a goal
- Metric: distance-to-kernel
- Explicit ban on “kernel center” semantics

These define what *safe* means.

---

### Violation Policy Spine (v1.0)

- Response enum:
  - HALT
  - DEGRADE_MODE
  - SANDBOX_ONLY
  - EXIT_WITH_REPORT
- Rolling escalation rules
- Event severity taxonomy
- Deterministic response policy

Failure handling is **explicit and final**.

---

### Q-SLEEVE (v0.1)

- Pre-claim / pre-authority containment layer
- Exploration without admissible claims
- One-way extraction only

Q-SLEEVE material is **never evidence**.

---

## ▶ What Is CURRENT (Active & Valid)

These artifacts are valid, usable, and may be **extended** — but may not redefine anything LOCKED above.

### Harness Specification (v0.1)

- Empirical envelope estimation
- Conservative, revocable bounds
- Hold-out falsification required
- Domain-limited by declaration

### Toy Kernels

- Explicitly artificial kernels for testing and demonstration
- Not claims about real system geometry

### Validated Notes

- Derived explanations or mappings
- Must reference LOCKED sources
- No new guarantees allowed

---

## ⏳ What Is INTENTIONALLY UNFINISHED

The following areas are open **by design**.  
Their absence is not a promise.

### Lane 3 — Implementation Mapping

- Runtime monitor wiring
- Control-flow enforcement
- Deterministic vs stochastic execution
- Code-level realizations

### Lane 4 — Optional Strengthening (Opt-In Only)

- Asymptotic convergence proofs
- Stochastic variants
- Multi-metric or adaptive kernels
- Learning or adaptation mechanisms

No unfinished item implies future inclusion.

---

## 🚫 Explicit Non-Goals

This project explicitly rejects:

- Claims of intelligence, agency, or consciousness
- Optimization objectives or goal states
- Autonomous decision authority
- Moral, legal, or safety certification
- Narrative or interpretive authority

Meaning is allowed.  
Authority is constrained.

---

## 📐 Interpretation Rules (Humans & AI)

- Folder names encode authority boundaries
- File headers override prose
- LOCKED > CURRENT > EXTENSION > SCRATCH
- Extensions may *consume* core outputs but may not redefine them
- Absence ≠ intent

If unsure, assume **lower authority**.

---

## Final Declaration

This MANIFEST exists to keep the system honest.

- Bounds over beliefs
- Failure over fantasy
- Clarity over cleverness

Anything not listed here is commentary.
