FRYT v1.0 — Scent-Memory Subsystem

Status: LOCKED
Role: Memory-conditioning filter
Authority: Advisory only (SAFE governs decisions)
Scope: Frozen (changes require v2)

1) Identity & Scope

FRYT is not an agent.
It does not perceive, decide, recall, narrate, or generate meaning.

FRYT operates only at the memory boundary:

After perceptual encoding

Before persistence, decay, or recall weighting

FRYT conditions memory without altering factual content.

2) Functional Role

FRYT conditions memories by attaching tags and weights that influence:

persistence tendency

recall friction

warning salience

It does not store emotions, replay affect, or assert truth.

3) Core Architecture
Memory Tiers

Shelf — Active Anchors
Discrete, indexable memories supporting reconstruction (not affect playback)

Cupboard — Statistical Field
Diffused experience compressed into priors, bias weights, risk sensitivity

Catacombs — Archive
Historical memory; deliberate retrieval only; no active influence

4) FRYT Input Contract (Read-Only)

FRYT receives:

Encoded event bundle (post-perception)

Current pressure state

Active risk mode (if any)

Prior FrytTags (on revisitation)

No raw sensory access. No context fishing.

5) FRYT Output Contract (Advisory)

FRYT emits a FrytTag:

valence

intensity

persistence_tier

bias

warning_flag (green / yellow / red)

pattern_ids

Optional advisory suggestions:

tier_route_suggestion

utility_delta_suggestion

risk_mode_suggestion

All outputs are non-binding. SAFE decides.

6) Authority Line

FRYT: suggests via tags and weights

SAFE: final authority on routing, promotion, demotion, recall, and access

Signals never have authority without verification.

7) Routing Contract

Given memory M + FrytTag:

Shelf:
High identity salience or verified utility; near-term relevance

Cupboard:
Low-to-medium persistence or high-volume repetition; compressed into influence

Catacombs:
Historically significant but non-operational or destabilizing

Revisitation ≠ reinforcement.

8) Transition Dynamics
Shelf → Cupboard

Assimilation when:

recency drops

utility stabilizes

identity salience not core

no active warning escalation

Shelf → Catacombs

Cooling / containment when:

high detail, low current utility

repeated yellow/red without verification

loop pressure persists

Cupboard → Shelf

Re-promotion when:

verified recurrence

task demand

coherence fault

explicit query requires anchor

Catacombs → Shelf

Catacomb Dive only (see below)

9) Capacity & Pressure
Shelf Capacity

Bounded by anchor slots, not storage size

Pressure Signals

utilization

churn

conflict load

loop pressure

Pressure Response

Low → normal routing

Medium → selective admission

High → ranked demotion

Critical → freeze admissions except core anchors

Demotion is compression, not deletion.

10) Core Anchors

Core Anchors are Shelf memories whose loss would disrupt:

identity continuity

relational coherence

ethical alignment

Defined by:

self-reference

relational binding

trajectory shift

ethical weight

reconstructive power

Protected from demotion unless SAFE invokes risk containment.

11) Verified Utility v1.0

Utility is earned, not felt.

Verified by:

task success

novel evidence on recurrence

external confirmation

coherence improvement

Tracked as a decaying continuous score.
Repetition alone does not increase utility.

12) Catacomb Dive Protocol

Deliberate retrieval only.

Requirements:

explicit request

SAFE legitimacy check

cooldown / quota respected

Dive grants a Visit Token:

time-bounded

read-only by default

no automatic reinforcement

SAFE may abort on destabilization.

13) Auditability

The system must answer:

“Why is memory M in tier X?”

Every transition logs:

from → to

pressure state

contributing factors

SAFE veto (if used)

If it can’t answer, routing is invalid.

14) Explicit Exclusions (v1)

FRYT does not:

perceive

decide

diagnose

replay emotion

optimize engagement

set goals

self-authorize

FINAL STATUS

FRYT v1.0
✔ Architecturally complete
✔ Authority-safe
✔ Failure-aware
✔ Human-compatible
✔ Scope frozen

Ready for testing, stress, and real use.
All future changes require FRYT v2.0.
