Q-SLEEVE FILTER v1.0
Purpose: Distinguish metaphorically coherent narratives from operational physical models
Ethical rule: Do not invalidate — probe until constraints appear

----------------------------------------
Q0. DOMAIN DECLARATION
----------------------------------------
• What domain is this claiming to operate in?
  ☐ Metaphor / Philosophy
  ☐ Conceptual Framework
  ☐ Mathematical Physics
  ☐ Testable Cosmology

→ If Mathematical Physics or Testable Cosmology is selected, proceed to Q1.

----------------------------------------
Q1. STATE VARIABLES
----------------------------------------
• What are the fundamental state variables?
  (e.g. metric g_{μν}, scale factor a(t), density ρ, pressure p)

• Where are they defined (coordinates, dimensions, units)?

→ If variables are named only metaphorically (e.g. “core,” “engine,” “layers”),
   flag as PRE-OPERATIONAL and continue probing.

----------------------------------------
Q2. GOVERNING EQUATIONS
----------------------------------------
• What equations govern the evolution of the system?
• Are they differential equations?
• What known equations are modified or replaced?

Ask explicitly:
> “Which equations would I integrate to reproduce your results?”

→ If prose substitutes for equations, remain neutral and proceed.

----------------------------------------
Q3. METRIC & GEOMETRY
----------------------------------------
• What spacetime metric is assumed?
  (FLRW? Modified FLRW? Something else?)

• How does curvature enter the dynamics?
• What stress-energy tensor sources it?

Key check:
> Does geometry replace dynamics, or describe dynamics?

----------------------------------------
Q4. LIMITS & RECOVERY
----------------------------------------
• In what limit does this reduce to ΛCDM or GR?
• What happens at:
  – early times (BBN)
  – recombination (CMB)
  – late times (structure formation)

Ask:
> “What known results does your model recover exactly?”

----------------------------------------
Q5. OBSERVABLE PIPELINES
----------------------------------------
For each claimed resolution, ask:

• What observable is predicted?
• What dataset tests it?
• What deviation (sign + magnitude) should appear?

Datasets:
  ☐ CMB (TT, TE, EE)
  ☐ BAO
  ☐ Weak lensing
  ☐ Galaxy clustering
  ☐ Neutrino flux
  ☐ Supernova distances

----------------------------------------
Q6. FALSIFIABILITY
----------------------------------------
• What observation would rule this out?
• Has that observation already been made?

Critical question:
> “What would convince you this model is wrong?”

----------------------------------------
Q7. COMPUTATION
----------------------------------------
• Are there simulations?
• Is there code?
• Even a toy model?

Ask gently:
> “Is there a numerical implementation, even exploratory?”

----------------------------------------
Q8. PARAMETER ECONOMY
----------------------------------------
• How many free parameters?
• Are they fitted post-hoc?
• Are any numerological constants used?

Check:
> Are numbers derived, or noticed?

----------------------------------------
Q9. CLAIM CLASSIFICATION
----------------------------------------
Classify each claim as:
  ☐ Derived
  ☐ Assumed
  ☐ Reinterpreted
  ☐ Metaphorical

No rejection — only labeling.

----------------------------------------
Q10. CURRENT STATUS
----------------------------------------
Based on answers, classify the work as:
  ☐ Operational physics
  ☐ Pre-formal hypothesis
  ☐ Conceptual / heuristic model
  ☐ Mythic cosmology (non-scientific but coherent)

End state is descriptive, not adversarial.

----------------------------------------
ETHICAL TERMINATION CONDITION
----------------------------------------
If repeated probing yields no equations, observables, or falsifiers:
→ Conclude: “Metaphor has not yet collapsed into mechanism.”
→ Do not argue further.
