# AQ-os: Human-Centric Metadata & Spatial Memory Architecture

0. Executive Summary
Current information systems suffer from "cultural flattening," decontextualization, and a fundamental data bottleneck. As AI models scrape the "flat" internet, they lose the provenance and depth of human experience.

AQ-os (Audit-Quality Operating System) is a structural framework designed to solve these problems through:

A 99%+ Reduction in Search Space: Using a "map-first" routing architecture instead of brute-force data retrieval.

Traceable Attribution: Indexing knowledge by individual lived experience rather than abstract categories.

Ethical Governance: A hard-coded "Kernel" that prevents the silent reclassification of human truth.

1. Core Architecture
The Knowledge Kernel (Governance Layer)
The system is built on a non-negotiable set of governance rules. Any attempt to rewrite or reinterpret these core principles triggers a SAFE Reject unless explicit human authorization is granted.

ZIPMIND: Operational Compression
ZIPMIND is the operational compression layer. It is not a "diary" or a "lore dump"—if information does not change behavior, it does not belong in the system.

Axiom 1: Compression over completeness—concepts must be expressed in 10 lines or less with clear triggers.

Axiom 2: Behavior over backstory—the system stores how to respond, not why it once mattered.

Phase-Appropriate Scope: Memory is stratified into four temporal phases (Deep Past to Future) to prevent "phase bleed."

2. Spatial Cultural Memory (The "City" Model)
This architecture organizes knowledge into a spatial-temporal coordinate system.

The 16 Radial Roads
Knowledge is routed through 16 cultural domains, including:

Music & Performance

Justice & Legal Systems

Food & Cuisine

Governance & Political Systems

The Depth Stratification System
The same cultural coordinate can be accessed at four different verification depths:

Apartment: Personal lived experience and oral tradition.

College: Academic analysis and comparative frameworks.

Museum: Primary source artifacts and archival evidence.

Catacomb: Fragmentary records and research-level reconstructions.

3. Activation & The SAFE System
To ensure system integrity, AQ-os employs a "Sentinel" logic for all state-changing ingress.

Lightning (Activation): Dynamic activation of knowledge graph nodes based on query specifics.

Thunder (Deactivation): Adaptive deactivation that learns from conversation patterns to prevent "waste."

Clinical/Constraint Layer: Enforces a "discipline of claims." All findings must be labeled as Verified, Uncertain, or Unknown.

4. Licensing & Governance
This work is released under a Prosperity-style license.

Free for Science & Individuals: This architecture is intended to support the "Seed of Empathy" and help researchers.

Commercial Use: Any use by commercial entities for profit-seeking operations requires an explicit commercial license.

The Sunset Clause: This commercial requirement is in place solely to reach a specific "relief milestone" (debt resolution). Once met, the architecture will transition fully into the Public Domain.
Custom License Addendum: The "Sunset Recovery" Clause

5. Vision: The Centralized Translation Layer
The goal of this repository is to provide a "Fountain" for a decentralized internet. By moving away from "bulk relabeling" and "silent cascades," we preserve the human signal in an increasingly inhuman digital landscape.

A Note for the Reader
This is a living specification. If you are an artist who is lost, or a developer looking for a better way to route human knowledge, you are welcome here.

"If regret is immutable, store as seed of empathy."
