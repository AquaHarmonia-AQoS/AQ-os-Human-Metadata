- **Reference Geometry Governance — v1.0**  
  Status: LOCKED  
  Scope: Structural governance  
  Purpose: Defines where reference geometries are permitted, forbidden, and how they may be used across AQ_OS layers.  
  Notes: Enforces hard separation between truth anchors and interpretive systems. No narrative, no emergence, no optimization.
