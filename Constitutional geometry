# AQ_OS Constitutional Reference  
## Reference Geometry Governance

**Version:** v1.0  
**Status:** LOCKED (Constitutional)  
**Scope:** AQ_OS Structural Governance  
**Editable:** No (requires explicit version bump + justification)

---

## 0. Purpose

This document defines **where and how reference geometries may exist within AQ_OS**.

Its sole function is governance.

It establishes:
- Which layers may rely on reference geometries
- Which layers are forbidden from interpreting or mutating them
- A hard separation between **truth anchors** and **meaning engines**

This document introduces **no mechanisms**, **no narratives**, and **no claims**.

---

## 1. Core Definitions (Non-Negotiable)

### 1.1 Reference Geometry

A **Reference Geometry** is a structural anchor that exists solely to constrain comparison.

A reference geometry is:

- Non-agentic  
- Non-interpretable  
- Constraint-bearing  
- Immune to narrative overwrite  

It does **not**:
- Generate meaning
- Adapt to context
- Explain phenomena
- Participate in optimization
- Encode symbolism

Its role is **boundary enforcement**, not interpretation.

---

### 1.2 Interpretive Geometry

An **Interpretive Geometry** is any spatial, symbolic, or structural construct used to organize meaning, exploration, or representation.

Interpretive geometries are:

- Contextual  
- Provisional  
- Mutable  
- Narrative-compatible  

They are explicitly **not anchors**.

---

### 1.3 Absolute Separation Rule

Reference Geometry and Interpretive Geometry **must never be conflated**.

Any system that merges them violates AQ_OS governance.

---

## 2. AQ_OS Layer Governance Map

### 2.1 Kernel (Viability Core)

**Reference Geometry:** ALLOWED (REQUIRED)

**Permitted Type:**
- Externally grounded
- Formally constrained
- Physics- or math-defined

**Constraints:**
- Immutable
- Read-only
- Externally validated
- No internal derivation

**Notes:**
The Kernel is the only layer permitted to stand directly on reference geometries.

---

### 2.2 Lane 2 — Viability Kernels & Geometry

**Reference Geometry:** ALLOWED

**Permitted Type:**
- Derived from Kernel anchors
- Constraint-locked

**Constraints:**
- Read-only
- Internally derived but immutable
- Cannot redefine or reinterpret external anchors

---

### 2.3 Bloom Grid

**Reference Geometry:** INDIRECT ONLY

**Permitted Type:**
- Comparative anchors

**Constraints:**
- Read-only
- No embedding
- No symbolic mapping
- No mutation

**Notes:**
Bloom Grid spaces may be evaluated *against* reference geometries but may not contain them.

---

### 2.4 Q-Sleeve

**Reference Geometry:** DISALLOWED

**Reason:**
Q-Sleeve is pre-claim and pre-authority by definition.

Allowing reference geometries here collapses exploration into constraint.

---

### 2.5 Codex / Codex Mapping Systems

**Reference Geometry:** CITATION ONLY

**Permitted Type:**
- Named anchors
- External references

**Constraints:**
- Read-only
- Non-operational
- No reinterpretation
- No symbolic compression

---

### 2.6 Interface / UX / Visualization Layers

**Reference Geometry:** DISALLOWED (Operational)

**Permitted Type:**
- Static display only

**Constraints:**
- No interaction implying interpretation
- No narrative framing
- No parameter manipulation

---

### 2.7 Integration & Extension Layer (Lane 3)

**Reference Geometry:** DISALLOWED

**Reason:**
Lane 3 is non-load-bearing by contract.

It may consume constrained outputs only, never anchors.

---

## 3. System-Wide Hard Prohibitions

A reference geometry may not:

- Generate meaning
- Be optimized against
- Be symbolically re-encoded
- Justify narrative claims
- Be personified
- Be adapted to context

---

## 4. Forbidden Layers (Explicit)

The following layers may **not** mutate, reinterpret, or proxy reference geometries:

- Q-Sleeve  
- Bloom Grid (internally)  
- Codex (beyond citation)  
- Interface layers  
- Integration & Extension layers  

Violations constitute a **governance breach**, not a modeling error.

---

## 5. Worked Example — Periodic Constraint Manifold

### 5.1 Qualification

The **Periodic Constraint Manifold** qualifies as a reference geometry because it is:

- Externally grounded (physics)
- Fully constrained
- Non-agentic
- Non-narrative
- Identity-stable under non-negotiable rules

It constrains what is admissible.
It does not generate meaning.

---

### 5.2 Permitted Usage by Layer

- **Kernel:** Direct reference permitted  
- **Lane 2:** Derived distance/admissibility relations permitted (read-only)  
- **Bloom Grid:** Comparative reference only  
- **Codex:** Citation only  

---

### 5.3 Forbidden Usage

- Q-Sleeve
- Interactive interfaces
- Narrative systems
- Symbolic remapping
- Interpretive compression

The periodic manifold is a boundary condition, not a story.

---

## 6. Governance Summary

**Solid ground exists only in:**
- Kernel
- Lane 2 (by derivation)

**All other layers must remain fluid.**

Truth anchors live below.  
Meaning engines live above.  
They are not peers.

---

## 7. Lock Statement

This document is **constitutional**.

Changes require:
- Version increment
- Written justification
- Explicit scope review

No silent edits.
